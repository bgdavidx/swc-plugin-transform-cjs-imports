# swc-plugin-transform-cjs-imports

Have you ever had an error like this while trying to use ESM?

```
import { promisifyAll } from "bluebird";
         ^^^^^^^^^^^^
SyntaxError: Named export 'promisifyAll' not found. The requested module 'bluebird' is a CommonJS module, which may not support all module.exports as named exports.
CommonJS modules can always be imported via the default export, for example using:

import pkg from 'bluebird';
const { promisifyAll } = pkg;
```

We did too, and didn't want to update every line in our codebase to support this, so we made this plugin.

Specify the list of modules that should be imported as CommonJS, and `swc-plugin-transform-cjs-imports` will automatically turn code such as:

```
import { promisifyAll } from 'bluebird'
```

into:

```
import _bluebird from 'bluebird'

const { promisifyAll } = _bluebird
```

This plugin only has one parameter, "modules", which is a list of the CommonJS modules you want to transform. 

For example, use this in your .swcrc to transform "bluebird":

```
{
    ...
    "experimental": {
      "keepImportAssertions": true,
      "plugins": [
        ["transform-cjs-imports", {
          "modules": [
            "bluebird"
          ]
        }]
      ]
    }
    ...
}
```

Enjoy!
